# DSP readiness for the rev C reconciliation window

The window deploys the DSP firmware, the panel MCU headers (H1S3/H1S4),
the app and the matrix to the rev C unit TOGETHER. This is the DSP leg,
made ready and proven ahead of it so the window is a deploy and not a
debug. **It is PW-gated; nothing here was deployed.**

## 1. The artifacts the window deploys

| | |
|---|---|
| contract | **`defs-v2026.09.08.4`** (defs `48745eae5418`), D24 matrix generation `3d41d5850df3`, 4,985 cells |
| dsp.csv commit | proposed **`54f2924`**, landed by the hub as `.4` **byte-identical** (row bytes diffed) |
| chip 1 image | `build/chip1.ldr` **md5 `602a0febbd1947d288c2ac36c3d3f4c7`**, 342,268 bytes, 9 blocks |
| chip 2 image | `build/chip2.ldr` **md5 `b1325022df2013821c357a22d8a054f7`**, 209,380 bytes, 7 blocks |
| build | `MW/D32/DSP/SHARC/build.sh` with no overrides — the shipping float configuration (`DSP4_BQ_FLOAT=1`, `DSP4_GAIN_FLOAT=1`, `DSP4_GEQ_DESIGN=1`, `DSP4_XOVER_DESIGN=1`, `DSP4_AFB_DESIGN=1`, `DSP4_BISECT=0`) |
| CPLD | unchanged — `dsp4_logic.a1f6672af6c3`, not reflashed in this session |
| staged on the bench | `app@192.168.1.219:~/dspboot/chip1.ldr` and `chip2.ldr` now hold exactly these two images |

The images were built twice: once from `proposals/defs/products/` before
the hub gate and once from `defs/products/` after `.4` landed. **Both
builds produced the same two md5s**, which is the proof that "built from
the proposal" and "built from the tag" are the same firmware.

## 2. What the panel MCU and the app must be built against

**`defs-v2026.09.08.4`, and nothing earlier will work.** The 31-band GEQ
re-lays chip 2: 1,192 D24 (1,460 D32) addresses move, chip 1 moves not at
all. A host holding `.2`'s or `.3`'s chip-2 map writes an aux limiter
threshold into an anti-feedback notch — silently, because every one of
those addresses answers. There is no shim and there should not be one;
the maps are told apart by the contract version.

Regenerate, do not hand-edit:

* `MW/D32/FW/H1S1/Core/Inc/ghost_cells.h` + `Core/Src/ghost_cells.c` —
  5,449 cells (both products merged)
* `MW/D32/FW/H1S1/Core/Inc/mx_dsp_map.h` — **5,409 entries, equal to
  D32's `dsp.csv` row count**, which is the check that the 09-08
  dispatch-map defect (2,064 cells missing by spelling) has not
  recurred. Every one of D32's 5,409 and D24's 3,737 addressed cells is
  present in `ghost_cells.c` by name.

## 3. Rollback

The previous shipping images are on the bench and untouched:
`~/dspboot/ship_chip1.ldr` md5 `3f0e479aee61219e18108ce27384295d`,
`~/dspboot/ship_chip2.ldr` md5 `ab43c75b56706341ba85268c217ce1dc`.
To reflash: `sudo systemctl stop matrix-app`,
`sudo pinctrl set 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,22,23,24,25 a0`, copy the two `ship_*`
files over `chip1.ldr`/`chip2.ldr`, then `python3 dsp4_boot.py --dir .`
and `dsp4_config.py --product d24 --chip 1|2` — **twice**, the config
commit desyncs the parameter link on the first cycle every time. Verify
the restore through `matrix-app`'s log (all three MCUs), not through
`dsp4_diag`: the shipping graph is over the per-block budget at block 8
and starves the main-loop poll, which reads like a fault and is not one.
Rolling the firmware back also rolls the address map back, so the panel
MCU and app must go back to `.2` with it.

## 4. The one-line acceptance to run on the unit after the window

```
cd MW/D32/DSP/SHARC && BUILD=0 ./famverify.sh && \
  python3 ../../../../tools/dsp/hw_coverage.py goldens/famverify-*.json
```

Pass is **17 of 20 families / 3,619 of 3,737 addressed cells**, GEQ at
**31/31** and CROSSOVER at **8/8**, with the report's `pin` reading
`defs-v2026.09.08.4`. Anything less means the host and the firmware are
not on the same map.

## 5. What the DSP is NOT bringing to the window

* **AUX_INPUT (8 cells)** — addresses answer, no stimulus path exists on
  this bench to move them. Not a firmware gap.
* **DCA (16 cells)** — host-managed by the 2026-08-30 ruling. The DSP
  applies no DCA gain and there is nothing on the part to probe.
* **METER (94 cells)** — no audio probe; `mtrverify.sh` is this family's
  bar and was not re-run in this session.
* The **fixed/shootout arms of `bqeverify`** do not link: chip 1's
  `sec_swco` overflows by 604 words under `DSP4_BQ_SHOOTOUT=1
  DSP4_BQE_VERIFY=1`. **Pre-existing** — the same arm at the previous
  commit (`e278667`) overflows by 386 — and it does not touch the
  shipping image, which links with 85,330 words of code free on chip 1.
  This session's work accounts for 218 of the 604.
