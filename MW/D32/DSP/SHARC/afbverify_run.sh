# reader, repair the CFG_COMMIT header word that lands in strip 1's gain on

# BENCH PIN HAND-BACK — the corrected sequence (S8-3, 2026-09-09).
# The line that used to be here, `pinctrl set 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,22,23,24,25
# a0`, is WRONG: GPIO24 in ALT0 is SD0_DAT2, not a deasserted chip select,
# so chip 2's CS sits asserted while chip 1's boot stream clocks out and the
# card comes up as TWO CHIP 1s. Six consecutive boots did that on 2026-09-09
# and only dsp4_scope.check_chip caught it — through dsp4_diag.py the card
# looks healthy with a wrong CHIP_ID, and every number taken through it is
# fiction. The chip selects (6 = chip 1, 24 = chip 2) are therefore HELD AS
# OUTPUTS DRIVEN HIGH, the two SPI_RDY lines (8, 12) are plain inputs, which
# is what gpiod claims them as, and only the SPI and JTAG pins go back to a0.
# CANONICAL TEXT — check_bench_pins.sh enforces it byte for byte across every
# run/flash script in the tree. Change it there, not here.
