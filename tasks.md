# tasks — dsp spoke

Status: active · reprioritized 2026-08-20 (hub declutter — the full prior
text, day logs, and done-evidence live verbatim in
[archive/tasks-archive-2026-08-20.md](archive/tasks-archive-2026-08-20.md);
nothing was deleted).
Purpose: current work state for the mx26 → mx-dsp workflow and DSP4
firmware. This file is also the HUB DISPATCH queue (mx26 "machines"
model): the hub prepends dispatch blocks; sessions on this machine
execute them, commit, push `main`; the hub reviews on pull.

Trunk is `main` (`master` deleted + blocked). Mandates: `CLAUDE.md`.
Contract pin: **defs-v2026.08.20** (mx26 `345470a`; see `defs.lock` —
sync-from-mx26.sh now refuses an untagged mx26 HEAD).

## NOW — priority order (set 2026-08-20)

**Context:** the rev-C card is LIVE on the fresh digital board — CPLD
`fd6a5ec69198` flashed + regression-passed, MH1/H1S3/H1S4 verify on every
boot, H1S1 built + verified but never flashed, and both SHARCs slave-boot
from the CM4 — currently wedged in `dma_cfg_init` (P2.2 bisect build left
running on chip1 overnight 08-19→08-20). This machine has direct SSH to
the unit (`app@192.168.1.219`) since 2026-08-20 — the hub-relay era is
over.

1. **P2.2 — dma_cfg_init wedge: resume the bisect.** [gate: PW reads LD2]
   - FIRST: bench LD2 on chip1. Steady 1 Hz square = `arm_region(A)`
     survives → move the park after `arm_region(B)`, repeat. Slow single
     blink = still dies inside `arm_region(A)` even with the address fix
     → next suspects: DMA CFG EN write order (write DSCPTR + CFG with EN
     clear, then set EN), descriptor alignment, the lane-4/cs-mask
     special case.
   - Real fix already applied (KEEP): `arm_region` converts every
     DDE-visible address core-L1 → SYSTEM via inlined `l1_to_sys()`
     (+0x28000000 for 0x00240000..0x003FFFFF; ADI libcc math). The hang
     persists at sub-step ≤4 after it — SPI2 diag readback still all-zero
     echoes.
   - Temp instrumentation in the tree (REVERT when done): `diag_stage_set()`
     stamps 1..7 in `dma_cfg_init` + `_diag_stage_set` helper in
     `diag.asm` + the park loop. Chip 2 runs the fixed un-instrumented
     build (hung, harmless).
   - Flash/boot loop, all runnable from here now: build → scp `.ldr` to
     `app@192.168.1.219:/home/app/dspboot/` → S_RESET `*` on
     `/dev/serial0` (hold slaves; matrix-app stopped) → `dsp4_boot.py
     --dir /home/app/dspboot` → observe/readback → app restart.
   - Boot-tool quirk: re-boot from a RUNNING/hung state fails its first
     attempt (SPI_RDY timeout) and works on the immediate retry,
     reproducible ×3 — add an auto-retry to the tool.
   - Before any slave boot with H1S1 flashed: confirm !RST_D ownership
     (H1S1 PA13 = `!RST_D` vs the boot script's GPIO16 pulse).

2. **Flash H1S1 — now CLEAR.** All eight CS pins verified
   `GPIO_MODE_INPUT` in the disassembled `H1S1.list` (CS7/8 2026-08-19;
   CS1-6 2026-08-20 hub dispatch — evidence in the archive). Build
   against the RUNNING app's matrix generation (matrix-aligned.h — same
   drift rule as panels; check with mx26 `tools/matrix_gen_id.py
   --compare`), pack, `app cli loadfw H1S1` (send S_RESET `*` first —
   MH1's `'?'` probe responder is pre-loop only). H1S1 has never been
   flashed; the DO-NOT-FLASH bar was exactly the CS GPIO problem, now
   closed.

3. **Clear the bisect scaffolding in `dma_config.c`** once P2.2
   concludes — `bca0dde`'s deliberate `for(;;)` park + diag stamps go;
   the `l1_to_sys()` fix stays. No image is shippable before this.

4. **dsp4_config.py — next tool up** once the wedge clears: expect LED
   stage 5 (waiting for host product config) → configure → stage 6 →
   audio → steady 1 Hz. Procedure + failure signatures:
   `MW/D32/DSP/diagnostics.md`. Also sync the gpiod-v2-ported
   `dsp4_config.py` / `dsp4_diag.py` copies back from
   `/home/app/dspboot/` (dsp4_boot.py already synced).

5. **Bench observations owed (PW):** LD1 ~1.5 Hz with the CPLD live;
   TEST1-4 on the scope (J15 DNP pads); blink-image rate = free CCLK
   measurement — write the measured rate down, don't just retune.

6. **Design note queued (PW 2026-08-19):** once RUNNING, the DSP diag
   LED and LOGIC LD1 should sync to the MH1 S_BLINK system heartbeat
   rather than free-run; diagnostic burst codes stay local.

## Blocked on PW (decisions, not work)

- **UART pass-through routing matrix** (`TODO(uart-passthrough)`):
  buffered pass-through vs selectable mux vs strobed arbiter. Pin
  inventory done; system decision needed before RTL. Audio bring-up
  only — not on the panel path.
- **D9 sign-off** (`dsp4-architecture-decisions.md`, [DRAFT] since
  2026-08-06): FPGA param plane — float wire, on-fabric ingest
  conversion, fixed ramps.
- **KR260 order** (SK-KR260-G; Farnell £323.57 vs ~$431 elsewhere,
  prices 2026-08-06). Procurement ONLY — the 2026-08-07 gate stands: no
  FPGA engineering until stable DSP+LOGIC on rev C. Capture order # +
  ETA here.
- **AI-attribution history question** — recommendation stands: LEAVE IT
  (59 pre-mandate commits keep trailers; rewriting means force-pushing
  new SHAs under ~15 cross-references). New commits carry none.

## Standing reference (condensed — full history in the archive)

**Lanes (2026-08-07 set):** (1) LOGIC CPLD — on hardware since 08-18;
unused-pin root cause fixed (`RESERVE_ALL_UNUSED_PINS` primary was unset
— every prior build ground-drove unused pins; trap documented in the
qsf), `fd6a5ec69198` flashed + regression-passed 08-19. (2) DSP firmware
— both SHARCs boot; six would-be-fatal bugs already found by HRM review
(IVT SEC vector, wrong SPI port, RUWM, EMISO, TXCTL, SEC ack); P2.2
wedge in progress. (3) FPGA — procurement only, gated.

**Card signs of life:** LD1 = LOGIC pin 59; LD3 = DSPA `PA_12`; LD2 =
DSPB `PA_12`; `PA_13` = shared `!BLINK` net (input — never drive).
TEST1-4 = CPLD pins 13/12/8/7 → J15 (DNP DIL254-10: pins 1/2 +3V3, odd
GND, even TEST1-4). LED fault codes: N flashes = completed stage N,
stuck in N+1 (1 SRU, 2 SPORT, 3 DMA, 4 int-enable, 5 waiting host
config, 6 configured/no audio); healthy = steady 1 Hz square. Diag
readback block at 0xE000 (24 regs + generic MMR peek window) via
`dsp4_diag.py` — the emulator substitute; every read carries an echo
word, checked host-side. SPI_RDY: chip1 GPIO8, chip2 GPIO12, FCPL=1
(ready = high; the 10K pulldown means in-reset reads not-ready). No
SHARC JTAG on rev C (JTG_* float; rev-D item — 2-pin SWD per chip is the
cheap option, ADI-tooling support unverified).

**Boot path:** CM4 SPI2 slave boot, BMODE 0b010; CS1/CS3 = DSPA, CS2/CS4
= DSPB (CS2 = GPIO24, NOT GPIO7); `!RST_D` = GPIO16 — ONE reset line for
BOTH DSPs (a reset re-boots both); 1024-byte units; spi0-0cs overlay (no
CE pins — GPIO7/8 stay JTAG TCK / CS3-RDY1). `dsp4_boot.py` = gpiod v2.
CM4 CPLD JTAG: TCK=GPIO7 TDO=22 TDI=23 TMS=25, IDCODE 0x020a30dd.

**Build:** `./build.sh all` in `MW/D32/DSP/SHARC/` (native 21564;
fit-proxy retired). Scratch copies need `cp -aL` — `Core/Inc/matrix.h`
is a symlink into `MX/` and plain `cp -a` leaves it dangling. H1S1/panel
MCU builds: Dropbox FW home via `Debug/makefile.linux` (CM4 or here);
access Dropbox through the space-free symlink `~/db` (escaped spaces
stall dispatched sessions).

**CCES licence (AD-CCES-NODE-1):** a node-locked activation COUNTER —
4 max, no customer-side release (ADI case CS-601771-T5L1J6); 1 of 4
spent on this box; a wipe or NIC change burns one permanently. Licence
material untracked in `cces-tools/` (gitignored); originals in Dropbox
`TransferOnly/`.

**Rev D:** single mod source = Dropbox
`TransferOnly/PCB mods/dsp4-revD-modlist.md` (D8 scope: CM4-core SPI
control; supervisor shrink → G0B1/U535; PSRAM on OSPI0 + runtime link to
SPI0/1; 5M570Z CPLD — PIN_8/TEST3 must move; hardwire-chunk pass;
OSPI = 3.3 V domain → S27KL-class HyperRAM or APS6404L). Rev-C bring-up
verifies the provisional TDM facts (BCKI/FSI pair order, CKRE/MFD, D24
within-ADC8 slot order, S4 strap) → then rev-D freeze. CPLD-driven
SWD_EN3 = rev-D wiring candidate (SPARE reaches neither CPLD nor U7 in
rev C).

**MCU hygiene notes:** MH1 `'?'` responder is pre-loop only (S_RESET
before `loadfw`; proper fix = `'?'` in the ISR dispatcher). CheckS
unbounded ready/BUSY spin-waits + the blocking-HAL-read-in-ISR pattern =
rev-D firmware hygiene (patched on MH1/H1S3/H1S4 2026-08-19 — audit
other CubeIDE projects before reuse).

**Cross-repo:** Dropbox `_Matrix` = canonical cross-repo store (absorbed
as `matrix-shared-store.md`); mx26 checkout at `~/mx26` for contract
syncs (`git -C ~/mx26 pull` first).

## P3 — contract evolution (waiting on mx26)

- Tier-2 slots staged in `defs.lock` (`D24_DSP_CFG_SHA256`,
  `D32_DSP_CFG_SHA256`, ABSENT until mx26 provides dsp.csv files).
  Resume: when mx26 adds `src/pd/d24/dsp.csv` or `src/pd/d32/dsp.csv`,
  run `./regenerate-dsp-contract.sh --update-lock`.
- FPGA mixer engine for larger products — idea folder seeded
  (`fpga/README.md`, `fpga/node-portability.md`); activation gate:
  becomes a numbered architecture decision first.
- `mx_master.csv` as cross-domain SOT — deferred; notes in `ideas.md`.

## Done (foundation, collapsed)

- Contract pipeline complete: defs.lock, sync-from-mx26.sh, hash
  verification, validate-matrix-contract.py, regenerate-dsp-contract.sh,
  check-contract-drift.sh, release-notes convention, smoke checklist.
- Alias retirement complete (2026-07-18); DSP mapping gap closed
  (349 cells added upstream).
- Fixed-point conversion (D5) COMPLETE 2026-07-31 — mainline is Q4.28;
  float archived at tag `float-kernels-2026-07-31`; golden harness 9/9.
- Fabric remap + product-config boot block + plumbing slices 1-3 DONE
  2026-07-31; diagnostics instrumentation DONE 2026-08-12.
- D24 schematics imported + hardware map derived
  (`MW/D24/HW/hardware-map.md`); binding decisions D1-D8 in
  `dsp4-architecture-decisions.md`.

## State snapshot (2026-08-20)

- Contract: defs-v2026.08.20 (mx26 `345470a`) — first pin on the clean
  5161-cell post-naming-pass D24 master; D24 _matrix 5125 rows, D32 6940.
- Firmware: unified DSP4 per dsp4-architecture-decisions.md; ~75-80%
  written, hardware-verified fraction low — bring-up is the work.
- Hardware: rev-C card live; SHARCs boot; dma_cfg_init wedge = the one
  open blocker on the audio path.

## Owners and cadence

- Owner: DSP workflow maintainer (dispatched sessions + PW bench).
- Review cadence: update on every contract bump and when NOW items move.
